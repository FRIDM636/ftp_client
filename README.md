## What is this:

this is a basic ftp client in python 
works with python 2.7 
using ftplib, standard access with 
anonymous user, simple upload/download functions
exceptions and errors are not handled here
multi threading capabilities not implemented

lib just contains used functions
in order to make the program more flexible for edition
## How to use:

use python `ftpclient.py -h` for help and commands

use python `ftpclient.py -l` to list files

use -u for upload 

use -d for download

use `python -B ftp_client` to avoid Bytecode generating

## Typical usage:

`python -B ftp_client -d -f 100MB.zip 10MB.zip 50MB.zip -o /path/to/downloads`

`python -B ftp_client -u -f /path/to/file1.ex  /path/to//file2.pdf`


## Features:

-download files form an ftp server

-upload files to an ftp server

-download multiple files sequentially if use pass multiple files name as arguments
 exp: 
 
 `python -B ftp_client -d -f  f1.ext f2.txt f3.mp4`

-download multiple files concurrently if you use multiple call to ftp_client.py
exp: 

terminal1: `python -B ftp_client -d -f  f1.ext `

terminal2: `python -B ftp_client -d -f  f2.txt`

terminal3: `python -B ftp_client -d -f  f3.mp4`

multi threading downloading not implemented yet


-upload multiple files sequentially if use pass multiple files name as arguments
